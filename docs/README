4. Query modification method
   Our query modification follows two phases. The first phase is to find
   relevant terms from the positive pages marked by the user. After
   that, we select the terms to expand from those relevant terms in the
   expansion phase.
   
   4.1 Finding relevant terms
      We collect the relevant terms from various sources.
